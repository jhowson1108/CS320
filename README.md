How do I ensure my code is functional and secure?

I write unit tests for each requirement and run them in CI so failures show up fast. I validate inputs (length, type, null checks), handle exceptions, and avoid hard-coding secrets. I use code reviews and static analysis to catch issues early, and I keep dependencies updated.

How do I interpret user needs and use them in a program?

I turn user stories and acceptance criteria into concrete behaviors and tests. I ask “what does success look like?” and map that to small features, edge cases, and data rules. Then I prototype, get feedback, and adjust before building the full solution.

How do I approach designing software?

I start simple: define the core use cases, sketch the data model, and outline modules with clear responsibilities. I prefer small, testable components, clean interfaces, and separation of concerns. I iterate in each step I build, test, refactor, and document so the design stays maintainable.
